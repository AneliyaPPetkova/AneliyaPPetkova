# Hi there, I'm Aneliya! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŒŸ I'm a software developer with a passion for solving complex problems and building innovative solutions. I've been working in the IT field for the past 10 years, and my journey has taken me from quality assurance to software development, where I've worked with a wide range of technologies and tools.

ðŸš€ I'm always eager to push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. I'm a skilled problem solver with strong analytical skills and an eye for detail, which helps me create elegant and efficient solutions to complex challenges.

ðŸ’» I'm always on the lookout for new and exciting projects to work on, whether it's building custom software for businesses or tinkering with the latest tech trends.

ðŸ¤– Some of the programming languages, technologies and CMS platforms I've worked with include ASP.NET Webforms, ASP.NET MVC, ASP.NET Core, Sitefinity, Wordpress, AWS, C#, Javascript, CSS, SASS, React, and more. I'm constantly learning and expanding my skill set, so there's always something new to discover.

ðŸ˜Š When I'm not coding, you can find me reading a good book, working in my garden, exploring new hiking trails, playing a game or reading the latest tech news and working on self improvement. I'm a firm believer that the best solutions come from a combination of creativity, curiosity, and hard work that includes constant learning, research and making iterations.
